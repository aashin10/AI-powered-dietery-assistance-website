# AI-powered Dietary Assistance Website 🍽️🤖

This project is an AI-powered web application that helps users track their meals by uploading photos. It analyzes the images, classifies the meal, and provides nutritional information and calorie content. Based on the user’s specific dietary needs, the website offers personalized recommendations to help users make healthier eating choices.

**Features 🌟**
	•	Meal Photo Upload: Users can upload photos of their meals for analysis.
	•	AI Classification: The website uses AI to classify the meal and extract nutritional information, including calories, protein, fats, carbohydrates, and more.
	•	Personalized Recommendations: Based on the user’s dietary requirements, the system suggests whether the meal is suitable or not.
	•	Hospital-Specific Diet Integration: The website takes input from hospitals to provide tailored meal recommendations for patients with specific dietary needs.

**Technologies Used ⚙️**
	•	Frontend: HTML, CSS JavaScript
	•	Backend: Flask, MySQL Workbench
	•	Machine Learning: TensorFlow, Keras
	•	Database: MySQL (for storing user and meal data)
	•	Image Processing: OpenCV, PIL                                        

**Usage 🚀**
	1.	Visit the website and create an account or log in.
	2.	Upload a photo of your meal.
	3.	View the nutritional breakdown, calorie count, and the recommendation about whether the meal fits your diet requirements.
	4.	Adjust the input settings based on the patient’s specific dietary needs.
